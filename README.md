# Megane CAN Bus
Reverse Engineering the CAN Bus of my Renault Megane II

So a few years ago I bought a second hand instrument cluster for my Renault Megane II just to play around a bit.
I tried some things at that unfurtunately didn't work so the cluster was put in a box.
Since last week I took it out to do some testing. Together with an Arduino and a CAN Bus shield I was able to power up the device by broadcasting some messages to the cluster.
I'm planning to reverse engineer the Megane CAN Bus for as far that's neccessary to play around with the cluster.
